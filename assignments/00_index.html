<h1>Computer Graphics, Spring 2022</h1>

<p>Here is a collection of projects I put together for my computer graphics course in the spring of 2022</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="01_circle_assignment.html">Drawing a Circle</a>: Learn how to work with HTML, Javascript and the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.
<li><a href="02_grapher_assignment.html">Graphing Calculator</a>: Create a graphing calculator, learn how to convert between spaces with lerp.
<li><a href="03_orthographic_projection.html">Orthographic Projection</a>: Create a basic 3d grapher, apply rotation matrices, work with indexed geometry.
<li><a href="04_perspective_projection.html">Perspective Projection</a>: Update your grapher to use perspective projection
<li><a href="05_color.html">Color</a>: Learn about various representations of color and how to draw quickly to a canvas.
<li><a href="06_dot_and_cross.html">Dot and Cross Products</a>: Learn about dot products, cross products, and linear combinations and their applications in computer graphics.
<li><a href="07_backface_culling.html">Backface Culling</a>: Apply what we know about dot and cross products to determine which faces of objects to draw.
<li><a href="08_z_buffer.html">Z-buffers</a>: By drawing our faces pixel by pixel and keeping track of the depths of those pixels we can get an even more accurate 3d model.
<li><a href="09_textures.html">Textures</a>: We can use the u and v coordinates calculated in the previous assignment to apply textures to our objects.
<li><a href="10_pipeline.html">Pipeline</a>: Comparing our 3d renderer to the graphics pipeline
<li><a href="11_threejs.html">THREE.js</a>: Now that we know how graphics rendering works, we'd like to use our graphics cards to speed up the process. We will be using WebGL: a version of OpenGL for the web, and THREE.js: a wrapper library to make working with WebGL easier.
<li><a href="12_spaces.html">Spaces</a>: Converting from model coordinates to world space to camera space involves a number of matrix operations and translations. We introduce a fourth coordinate set to 1 so these operations are just matrix operations and explore how these matrices are set up and composed.
<li><a href="13_procedural_geometry.html">Procedural Geometry</a>: We learn how to create our own geometry, specifying vertex coordinates and additional attributes for vertices.
<li><a href="14_shaders.html">Shaders</a>: Shaders allow us to execute arbitrary code in a language called GLSL at two key stages of the graphics pipeline.
<li><a href="15_uniforms.html">Uniforms</a>: Uniforms allow us to pass data to our shaders, including slider values, the current time, and texture data.
<li><a href="16_lighting.html">Lighting</a>: All modern graphical effects are achieved with shaders. In this assignment, we make our own lighting shaders.
<li><a href="17_above_and_beyond.html">Above and Beyond</a>: A list of some advanced graphics techniques to look into and resources for learning more about computer graphics.
